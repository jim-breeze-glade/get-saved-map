This is a project to geocode a church directory from 'militarygetsaved.net' and so far my tests for Arkansas are working perfectly deployed when to github pages. I would like to use the same *state*Churches.ts structure to add the remaining 49 states if you wouldn't mind creating those from the source website. The site uses the format 'militarygetsaved.net/*statename*' (with no spaces for two word states like 'new jersey' eg. 'militarygetsaved.net/newjersey') for each state and has a list of each churches address, pastor, and some other relevant info. Instead of 'Arkansas Baptist Churches Map' I'd like the title to be updated to 'KJV Baptist Church Finder' and add a thank you at the top of the page to 'militarygetsaved.net' and a link to visit the site. The site should allow you to click the 'Select State' button to expand a list of all 50 states to simply select a state from a list on the sidebar and populate the map with geocode pins from the stored '*state*Churches.ts'. Once the state is selected the list should collapse and allow users to easily filter the pins using the existing color-coded options. Use all relevant agents to ensure the project passes npm audits and ci/cd standards. I had issues previously with security vulnerabilities with the geocoding function's axios dependency so please keep security at the forefront of your attention during development. Next to security, ease of use for users with little technical savvy is a primary concern.
